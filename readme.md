# NSE PE Ratio and Bulk Deals Notification Bot

This repository contains two Python scripts that interact with the NSE (National Stock Exchange of India) to fetch P/E ratios for popular indices and the latest bulk and block deals. The results are sent to a specified Telegram chat using a Telegram bot.

## Overview

### Script 1: P/E Ratio Notification

This script retrieves the current and historical P/E ratios for the following indices:
- NIFTY 50
- NIFTY 500
- NIFTY SMALLCAP 250

It sends a formatted message to Telegram with the following details:
- Today's P/E ratio
- Average P/E ratios for the last week, month, and six months for NIFTY 50
- Today's P/E ratio and average for the last six months for NIFTY 500 and NIFTY SMALLCAP 250.

### Script 2: Bulk and Block Deals Notification

This script fetches the latest bulk and block deals from the NSE and sends the top 5 buying deals to the specified Telegram chat.
